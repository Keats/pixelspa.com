# The mighty pixelspa.com

## Quick glossary
- Git: version control tool, allow you to go back to previous version and see history
- Github: service for Git in the cloud
- Cloudfare: a caching service that provides https
- Npm: javascript package manager, we use it for the css/publishing
- Hugo: the static site builder, transforms markdown into html, not used yet


## Local setup
Since Mac doesn't have a package manager, install Homebrew by following the instructions at [http://brew.sh/](http://brew.sh/).

Next we need to install Node.js, npm and Hugo.  
Open a terminal and type:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install git
$ brew install node
$ brew install hugo
```

To make sure you have them, type:

```bash
$ node -v
# should display a version number
$ npm -v
# should display a version number
$ hugo version
```

*From now on, all the commands you see needs to be execute in the folder where this README is.*

Go in this folder in the terminal and type to install the nodejs dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the site locally
```bash
$ hugo server
```
Site will be available at http://localhost:1313/

## Add case study
All case studies are located in `pixelspa/content/projects`.
The easiest way to add a new project is to copy one of the existing folder and rename it.

There is a `index.md` file for each project that contains the metadata and the text. For example:

```
+++
title = "The Sun UK homepage WYSIWYG editor"
client = "Human Made/The Sun UK"
colours = []
date = "2016-04-27"
tags = ["TAG", "TAG", "TAG"]
url = "sun-editor"
listimages = ["sun-list.png", "sun-list@2x.png"]
draft = true
+++
```
Note that all the metadata need to be between `+++` lines.
`colours` is unused for now, it's meant to represent the colour palette later on. `url` is what url you want the project page to be, ie it will be `http://www.pixelspa.com/sun-editor` in the example above.

## Blocks
Markdown doesn't work magically for all the use case the design needs to do so I added some blocks.

### Quote
Use it like so:
```
{{< quote >}}
Blabla
{{< /quote >}}
```
No option for that one.

### Pic
The most complex block. Use it like that:

```
{{< pic src="before.png" src2x="before@2x.png" caption="The Childrenâ€™s Society website - before" > bg="#ccc"}}
```

This one represents all possible options, `caption` and `bg` are optional, only `src` and `src2x` are mandatory.

The `src` and `src2x` field need to refer to the filenames in the same folder as the `index.md` file.

Note: don't put double quotes (`"`) in the caption.

### Bgtext
Gives a background color to the text. Use it like so:
```
{{< bgtext "#f5f6f4" >}}
blabla
{{< /bgtext >}}
```

The color is mandatory and can be any valid css color (rgb, rgba, hex, etc).

## Publish
Simply type:

```bash
$ ./deploy.sh
```

This will do the commit and push to github so you should not need to actually use git unless you edit directly from github. At which point i'll edit this readme
