## Local setup
Since Mac doesn't have a package manager, install Homebrew by following the instructions at [http://brew.sh/](http://brew.sh/).

Next we need to install Node.js and npm.  
Open a terminal and type:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install node
```

To make sure you have them, type:

```bash
$ node -v
# should display a version number
$ npm -v
# should display a version number
```
