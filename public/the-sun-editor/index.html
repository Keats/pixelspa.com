<p>I joined the Wordpress gurus at Human Made and The Sun UK tech team as UX consultant and visual designer to help them design their internal content management system.</p>

<p>Editors and journalists at The Sun UK that daily update the content of the homepage, needed an easy way to populate the page and edit the content on the go.</p>

<h2 id="gathering-requirements:d680e8a854a7cbad6d490c445cba2eba">Gathering requirements</h2>

<p>In a day-long energising workshop that involved editors, product managers, designers and software engineers, we talked about what type of users would use the platform and what type of tasks would they want to accomplish.</p>

<p>To gather everyone’s ideas I’ve chosen the Vision Board format, that compares users, needs/goals, features and the value they bring.</p>

<h3 id="needs-vs-features-drag-drop-or-click:d680e8a854a7cbad6d490c445cba2eba">Needs vs Features: Drag &amp; drop or click?</h3>

<p>Some of the editors were really keen in having a ‘drag and drop’ functionality because it is nice and intuitive.</p>

<p>In this case ‘drag &amp; drop’ is considered a feature, a way to achieve a goal, the goal of ‘moving things around easily’. What if there were plenty of other solutions to get the same outcome?</p>

<p>Sometimes what seems like a good solution might not be the best and a designer should always take a step back and question the real users goals.</p>

<p>In this scenario drag &amp; drop seemed unnecessary and even frustrating as source and destination might not be both in view and in reach, therefore we preferred using simple clicks to select articles and available slots.</p>

Tell me what you want and I’ll tell you what you need.

<h2 id="sketching-wireframing:d680e8a854a7cbad6d490c445cba2eba">Sketching/Wireframing</h2>

<p>After having analysed all the materials from the workshop I started sketching some possible interfaces to make some order in my head and compare my understanding with the rest of the team.</p>

<figure >
	
	    <img 
	        alt=""
	        srcset="https://pixelspa.com/projects/sun-editor/the-sun-sketches.png 1x, https://pixelspa.com/projects/sun-editor/the-sun-sketches@2x.png 2x" />
    
    
</figure>


<h3 id="editing-tools:d680e8a854a7cbad6d490c445cba2eba">Editing Tools</h3>

<p>We successively dived into more detail starting from the article preview itself. The editors needed some tools to accomplish certain tasks such as editing articles headlines and images, resizing them and moving articles to different slots. How to access those tools and what the best way to display them?</p>

<p>After considering different options we opted for a small toolbar that would appear when clicking on each article block. My aim was to keep the editing interface as invisible as possible, as WYSIWYG should be.</p>

<p>Testing the toolbar on the tiniest of the article blocks seems to work fine:</p>

<figure >
	
     	<img 
	        alt="A little prototype of the toolbar"
	        src="https://pixelspa.com/projects/sun-editor/toolbar-interaction.gif" />
    
    
        <figcaption>
            <p>A little prototype of the toolbar</p>

</figure>


<h3 id="swapping-articles-sections:d680e8a854a7cbad6d490c445cba2eba">Swapping Articles/Sections</h3>

<p>As well as editing each article block, it was necessary to edit the page at higher level: change article position and move entire sections of the page up and down.</p>

<p>I evaluated and prototyped different options using very simple wireframes with colorful blocks.</p>

<figure >
	
	    <img 
	        alt="Example of simple flow to move an article to a different slot"
	        srcset="https://pixelspa.com/projects/sun-editor/article-blocks-prototype.png 1x, https://pixelspa.com/projects/sun-editor/article-blocks-prototype@2x.png 2x" />
    
    
        <figcaption>
            <p>Example of simple flow to move an article to a different slot</p>
        </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>Moving A to B it’s a pretty simple flow part from the fact that it’s not. The interface needs to answer questions like “What article am I moving?”, “Where can I move it to?”, “ How is it going to look like?”, “What happens when I’ve finished swapping articles?”, “What if I changed my mind?”</p>

<p>To answer those questions, notifications and visual cues play a significant role.</p>

<figure >
	
	    <img 
	        alt="Notifications"
	        srcset="https://pixelspa.com/projects/sun-editor/messages.png 1x, https://pixelspa.com/projects/sun-editor/messages@2x.png 2x" />
    
    
        <figcaption>
            <p>Notifications</p>
        </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<h2 id="design:d680e8a854a7cbad6d490c445cba2eba">Design</h2>

<p>Once happy with the overall layout I started translating my sketches into more high-fidelity mock ups.</p>

<h3 id="sourcing-content:d680e8a854a7cbad6d490c445cba2eba">Sourcing Content</h3>

<p>To source content for the homepage and potentially the rest of the website we created a panel where it&rsquo;s possible to search and filter the library of articles and images by keyword, date range and section.</p>

<p>From the panel you can see what the latest articles are and which ones are still in progress. Color coding for the bars on the left allows to see at glance the section the articles belong to.</p>

<p><figure >
	
	    <img 
	        alt="Articles list"
	        srcset="https://pixelspa.com/projects/sun-editor/left-panel.png 1x, https://pixelspa.com/projects/sun-editor/left-panel@2x.png 2x" />
    
    
        <figcaption>
            <p>Articles list</p>
        </figcaption>
    
</figure>
</p>

<h3 id="clipboard:d680e8a854a7cbad6d490c445cba2eba">Clipboard</h3>

<p>The clipboard is a temporary storage for articles.</p>

<p>Editors can now play around with the homepage layout and, when they need to retrieve some of the articles they removed, they can just reimport them from the clipboard.</p>

<p>Useful indeed!</p>

<p><figure >
	
	    <img 
	        alt="Clipboard"
	        srcset="https://pixelspa.com/projects/sun-editor/left-panel-clipboard.png 1x, https://pixelspa.com/projects/sun-editor/left-panel-clipboard@2x.png 2x" />
    
    
        <figcaption>
            <p>Clipboard</p>
        </figcaption>
    
</figure>
</p>

<p>These are just some examples of the features we designed, there is much more that the editorial interface can do, and the engineers and product team at The Sun UK are working constantly to improve it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad I had the chance to kick-start with them this project to create a useful system that will speed up someone&rsquo;s daily tasks!</p>
