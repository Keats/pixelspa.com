The Children’s Society is a UK charity which fights childhood poverty, harm and neglect through direct practice, policy work and campaigning. They recently undertook their first rebranding exercise in 16 years and needed someone to execute the new brand digitally. I had the chance to work on this project while working at Manifesto Digital.

## The goal

> Develop and implement a new design for the Children’s Society website that embodies their new brand identity and helps the Children’s Society fight for change and support disadvantaged children to have better lives.

## Immersion & discovery

After an energising kick-off meeting followed by a phase of research that allowed us to learn more about the Children’s Society audience, we started redefining user journeys experimenting with different possible layouts and creative routes. 

With new print guidelines in hand, I had the hard job to represent digitally their new brand essence, which, summarised in 2 words was:

Definitely a drastic change comparing to where they were coming from. But to fully understand how hard hitting they wanted to be, we asked them to position themselves in on a line where we compared them to similar organizations and their messages.

## Moodboard

I’ve built a moodboard of different design elements to understand what type of website they were going for. We sticked all the different examples on the wall of our meeting room and literally asked the client to point at what they liked/disliked.

{{< bgtext "#f5f6f4" >}}
We agreed that the website would have to include large good quality images, bold statements, facts and figures. White on black, like hard truths. We wanted to create an engaging experience for the users but decided to stay away from the long scrolling websites patterns. A megamenu as navigation was our solution to show the complex architecture of the website, which we also helped simplify.

## Sketching / Wireframing
Once I got a good feeling of what was the best creative route, I started sketching and wireframing some of the journeys which we quickly prototyped and tested. 

These were the final layouts:

## Design 
Here is how all our initial studies translated into the final design of the pages:
